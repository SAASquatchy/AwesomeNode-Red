## What is Node Red

Node-Red is an open source visual editor for connecting the internet of things developed by IBM. This means it helps you spend more time making stuff talk to each other writing the code you'll need to make it work. 

The system is built with "Nodes" which are icons that you drag and drop on to the canvas and connect together. Each Node offers different functionality, from a simple debug node to be able to see what's going on in your flow, to a Raspberry Pi node which lets you to read and write to the GPIO pins of a Pi.
